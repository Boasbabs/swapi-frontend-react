### Task

Create a small app using any of Angular, Vue or React that lists the names of Star
Wars movies in a dropdown and the opening crawl of the selected movie below
the selection along with a list of the characters that appear in that movie.

### General requirements

- The UI should have a basic theme of black and yellow; visual design is low in the priority list
- Movie names in the dropdown to be sorted by release date from earliest to
newest
- There should be no movie selected initially and the app should show the Star
Wars logo instead of movie information
- The opening crawl of the selected movie should be animated, a simple
scrolling marquee text would be sufficient
- â„ªeep your application source code on a public Github repository
- Provide a live demo url (Codesandbox, Glitch, Netlify, Zeit Now, Heroku and
Github Pages are good options).

### Data requirements

- The data should be fetched online from https://swapi.co
- Loading indicators should be shown in proper places while fetching data
- Error messages should be shown if there are any errors

### Character list requirements

- All characters that appear in that movie should be listed showing name,
gender, and height in the form of a table.
- Gender can be shown as an icon or abbreviation to save horizontal space.
- Character list can be sorted by clicking on the table headers.
- Clicking on the same header twice toggles the sort order by the field between
ascending and descending.
- There should also be a gender filter selection right above the list so that either
all characters are listed or only the selected gender are listed.
- The last row of the table should show the total number of characters currently
visible on the list.
- The last row should also show the sum of the heights of the characters
currently visible.
- The sum of heights should be shown both in cm and in feet/inches in
parenthesis, for example, 170 cm (5ft/6.93in)
